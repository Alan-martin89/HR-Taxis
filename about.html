            <p class="history">Laura Symons<blockquote class="history">We asked Harris to help with our wedding day, he collected the bridesmaids in his very clean 8 seater- bow and all! Took them to church, collected after to deliver them to the marquee, as well as any stray guests. We then asked him to do 10pm-2am based at the marquee to make sure everyone could get home, including us. Everyone who used him said how nice he was, professional and delivered everyone safely. He’s great to call after a night out or for special occasions.<br>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</blockquote></p>

            <p class="history">Vanessa Gray<blockquote class="history">We booked Harris to take us to Heathrow airport and pick us up after the holiday. The car was freshly valeted both trips and he thoughtfully provided bottled water for the journey. Booking was easy, the ride was smooth and Harris confirmed all the arrangements again the day before. Reliable and friendly service. Will definitely book Harris again.<br>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</blockquote></p>

            <p class="history">Zoe Baber<blockquote class="history">I have used Harris and his services for over a year. He has been reliable, professional, safe and extremely understanding, even when he had to wait for us to have our PCR tests, pre airport transfer. The transfer from London Heathrow to the south hams was extremely comfortable, with water provided. I highly recommend using, I definitely will not be using anyone else to complete our transfers in the future.<br>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; </blockquote></p>

            <p class="history">Brooks Newmark<blockquote class="history">Highly recommend HR Taxis. Pre booked, was on time, vehicle clean, was value for money. Harris is a great driver. The first time I have used HR Taxis. They will now be my first choice when I need a taxi service.<br>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</blockquote></p>

            <p class="history">David Hamilton<blockquote class="history">We arrived in a hard to access campsite and got lucky finding Harris who ran us into Salcombe town. He literally couldn’t do enough for us to the extent we used him exclusively over the two days we stayed, for multiple journeys. He was amazing. Exceptionally professional, punctual and happy to advise us on where to go, where to eat, to the point he was almost running our itinerary &#128513;.<br> I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend HR Taxis Kingsbridge to anyone visiting the area and if I’m ever back down this way Harris would be the first person in call to get me around.<br>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</blockquote></p>
